The goal of `silviculture` is to provide functions that accelerate the analysis of forestry data, specially data related to forest inventories.

## Installation

You can install the development version of silviculture from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

## Note

This package is currently under active development and may still contain bugs or unstable features. I do not recommend using it in real-world applications at this stage, as it may be prone to errors.
